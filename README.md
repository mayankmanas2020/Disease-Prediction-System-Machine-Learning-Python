This project is a Diabetes Risk Prediction System built using Machine Learning in Python. Leveraging the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with Scikit-learn, the model analyzes nine health-related features to accurately classify and predict the likelihood of diabetes, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 92â€“93%. The system was developed with a strong focus on usability, featuring an interactive web application built in Streamlit that allows users to input their health data and instantly receive predictions. To make sharing and testing easy, the application was deployed locally and made accessible via LocalTunnel, enabling quick demonstrations without complex hosting setups.
